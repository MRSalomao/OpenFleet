# SmallSat Planner

Project for professor Peter Allen's Humanoid Robots course. The objective is to use different planning techniques to evaluate the proposal of adding propulsion mechanisms to existing SmallSats. Such addition would allow SmallSat constellations to achieve novel magnitudes of control, facilitating tasks such as stereo imaging or interplanetary missions.

## Selected Libraries and Technologies

OMPL and ODE. 

Possibly Cuda, in the future.

Some engine for 3D rendering - still under research.
